# AI-Powered-Resume-Screening-Candidate-Ranking-System

Welcome! This project is a smart, AI-powered solution built to help recruiters screen resumes faster, better, and without bias. It uses Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing to rank candidates based on how well their resumes match a job description.

This was developed as part of the AICTE Internship on AI: Transformative Learning, supported by TechSaksham – a joint CSR initiative by Microsoft & SAP.



# What Does This Project do?

Hiring can be exhausting—especially when recruiters have to go through hundreds of resumes manually. This tool makes life easier by:
-Letting users upload resumes (PDF/docx)
-Automatically extracting key information (skills, education, work experience)
-Ranking candidates based on how well they fit the job
-Giving a clean and simple UI for recruiters to review and adjust results



# Working of the Project

1. Upload your resume (PDF or DOCX).
2. The system cleans and parses the text using NLP.
3. It pulls out details like skills, experience, and education.
4. Based on the job description, it scores and ranks the resume.
5. The recruiter gets a clear view of the best-fit candidates.



# Sneak Peek

The app has a dark, minimal UI. Once a resume is uploaded, the parsed details appear in a simple JSON-like format. It also shows a ranking score to help recruiters make faster decisions.



# Future Advancements & Enhancements

1. Make skill extraction more accurate with spaCy/BERT
2. Smarter ranking using better embeddings (TF-IDF, BERT)
3. Add live feedback on resumes (how to improve them)
4. Make the UI more interactive with visual insights
5. Handle edge cases like missing or oddly formatted resumes
